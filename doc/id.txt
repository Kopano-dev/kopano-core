Cheatsheet on all ID things


These are notes and not normative. Specifically, code should not rely
on this document's claims.


== GUID / MAPIUID ==

DCE-type GUIDs: 1 32-bit little-endian integer, 3 16-bit little-endian
integers, 6 bytes.

  * GUIDs in the KC SQL database are stored in LE.

  * GUIDs in memory are LE as well. As they are moving around in memory a lot,
    byteswapping should happen at time of access, not at time of
    reading/writing them from/to another place.

  * Comparisons of equality with another GUID work right away.

  * Comparisons of ordering need byteswapping. Sorting GUIDs by the byte does
    not carry a lot of meaning; they are random identifiers most of the time,
    and if one were to sort per the DCE spec, an unnatural order is the result.


== ENTRYID ==

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/entryid
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/mapi-entry-identifiers

Four flag bytes, and then variadic length identifier that only means something
to MAPI. And maybe kopano-admin. Do not attempt to parse.

mapi4linux's IMAPISession::CompareEntryIDs and IMAPISupport::CompareEntryIDs do
a byte-level compare only. This is not in line with what MSDN says MAPI32
implements.


== Profiles ==

  * Identified by name at all times.

  * Contains zero or more message services.


== Message services ==

  * Identified by MAPIUID, generated randomly at instantiation and returned by
    CreateMsgServiceEx. Exposed through IID_IProfSect as PR_SERVICE_UID.

  * Instantiation call specifies the kind of service (e.g. "ZARAFA6").

  * Contains one or more profile sections. Among this are the "global profile
    section" (global to the service) and one section per provider UID.

  * Contains zero or more providers.


== Profile section ==

  * Container for properties.


== Provider ==

  * Identified by MAPIUID. Fixed value declared by e.g. kopano.inf.

  * Exposed through IID_IProfSect as PR_PROVIDER_UID. (PR_SERVICE_UID exposed
    too.)

  * Exposed through message store objects (IID_IMsgStore, IID_IFolder,
    IID_IMessage, etc.) as PR_AB_PROVIDER_ID (only for MAPI_AB_PROVIDER),
    PR_MDB_PROVIDER (only for MAPI_STORE_PROVIDER). Can be used to determine
    whether any two objects are served by the same provider/module.

  * Instantiated by from within CreateMsgServiceEx > CreateProviders. (You
    always get them by default when instiating a message service, but can
    delete them later through IProviderAdmin.)

  * Different types of providers, e.g. MAPI_AB_PROVIDER, MAPI_STORE_PROVIDER,
    MAPI_TRANSPORT_PROVIDER. Exposed as IID_IProfSect:PR_RESOURCE_TYPE.


== ENTRYID forms in KC ==

"Abstract form 1" (term invented here)
"Abstract form 2"
ZCP/KC EID v1
ZCP/KC EID v0
ZCP/KC ABEID v1
ZCP/KC ABEID v0
ZCP/KC SIEID v0
Wrapped Store Entryids


AF1: MAPI specifies that bytes 0–3 of an entryid are used for
lifetime/scope/etc. flags and that the remainder is unspecified.

AF2: Despite the previously declared unspecified nature of entryids, a lot of
entryids have the 16-byte provider UID is placed at bytes 4–19 at times(when?).
Some functions, such as the generic CompareEntryIDs (from MAPI, not the
provider), interpret said bytes to determine which provider to forward the call
to.


== ZCP/KC EID v1 ==

EID v1 is used for message store objects, i.e. stores, folders in stores
(includes store root folder), and messages in such folders. It was introduced
in ZCP 6.

"struct EID" [kcore.hpp] is only used as a "looking glass", that is, it is only
valid (and limitedly so) to use it in a pointer access, due to a flexible array
member. C++ code must never instantiate an object of such type (and class magic
was added to enforce this). The instantiable form is "struct EID_FIXED".

Hex representation that might show up during debug:

	00000000D6B33C45FF074F2288F544E3492E4D0D0100000001000000~
	--------ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggvvvvvvvvttttffff~
	~58178E703AD6441C9F78DDAB015453D300000000
	~uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuPPPPPPPP

	-: standard entryid flags, e.g. lifetime/scope
	g: store GUID
	v: version (1)
	t: type (MAPI_FOLDER / MAPI_MESSAGE / ...)
	f: flags
	u: randomly-generated GUID, different for each object
	P: padding

	Size: always 48 bytes

EID v1 is not conforming to AF2. Whether this was a historic design mistake or
an acceptable choice has not been researched as of yet.

Because the portion left of the pad bytes always has a multiple-of-4 length,
the padding turns out to be redundant. This is a historic design mistake
throughout many EID forms.


== ZCP/KC EID v0 ==

EID v0 was a ZCP 0.x thing. Nowadays, EID v0 only used for a few internal
hard-coded always-there objects.

"struct EID_V0" [kcore.hpp] is like EID in that it cannot be instantiated. The
hardcoded entryids only appear in SQL statements and so there was no need
(unlike abcont_1, see below) to have an instantiable variant.

	000000008962FFEFFB7B4D639BC5967C4BB5823400000000010000000100000000000000
	--------ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggvvvvvvvvttttffffnnnnnnnnPPPPPPPP

	-: standard entryid flags
	g: store GUID
	v: version (0)
	t: type (MAPI_FOLDER / MAPI_MESSAGE / ...)
	f: flags
	n: object id (id in SQL "hierarchy" table; hierarchyid in others)
	P: padding

	Size: always 36 bytes

A maximum of 2^32 objects can be represented only.
EID v0 is also not conforming to AF2.


== ZCP/KC ABEID v1 ==

Address book entryid from ZCP 6.30 onwards. It is used to refer to security
objects (users, groups, companies).

"struct ABEID" [kcore.hpp] is like EID in that it is not instantiable.
See "struct ABEID_FIXED" for an instantiable form.

	00000000AC21A95040D3EE48B319FBA7533044250100000006000000040000004D...
	--------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxvvvvvvvvttttttttiiiiiiiiee+PP+

	-: standard entryid flags
	x: provider UID (MUIDECSAB)
	v: version (1)
	t: type (MAPI_MAILUSER / MAPI_DISTLIST / MAPI_ABCONT)
	i: object id (id from the "users" SQL table; user_id in some others)
	e: base64 of externid, variable length (min 0, max 4294967268)
	P: padding, variable length (min 1, max 4)

	Common sizes: 40/44/48/52 (RFC2307) or 60 bytes (MSAD)

Because of the base64-encoded part, the "e" portion is always a multiple of 4
bytes (unless willingly corrupted), and as a consequence, the entire portion
left of the pad bytes always has a multiple-of-4 length, the padding turns out
to be redundant. This is a historic design mistake.

ABEID v1 conforms to AF2 (the provider UID is always at bytes 4–19).


== ZCP/KC ABEID v0 ==

Another address book entryid. Used to refer to internal always-there objects
that have no externid. The "struct ABEID" looking glass can equally be used.

	00000000AC21A95040D3EE48B319FBA75330442500000000060000000200000000000000
	--------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxvvvvvvvvttttttttiiiiiiiiPPPPPPPP

	-: standard entryid flags
	x: provider UID (MUIDECSAB)
	v: version (0)
	t: type (MAPI_MAILUSER / MAPI_DISTLIST / MAPI_ABCONT)
	i: object id (id from the "users" SQL table; user_id in some others)
	P: padding

	Size: always 36 bytes

ABEID v0 conforms to AF2.


== ZCP/KC SIEID v0 ==

Single Instance entryids [kcore.hpp] were introduced in ZCP 6.30. They follow
the MAPI ENTRYID scheme, but are actually never used at or for the MAPI level
(calls like IMsgStore::OpenEntry or so). They only appear on the protocol
spoken between libkcclient and server.

	000000007976ED54D0D211DD9705BE5055D89593000000000137000001000000~
	--------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxvvvvvvvvttttttttiiiiiiii~
	~9CF83DB275134BE981558ED7C5577CD500000000
	~ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggPPPPPPPP

	-: standard entryid flags
	x: provider UID (MUIDECSI_SERVER)
	v: version (0)
	t: proptag (commonly PR_ATTACH_DATA_OBJ / PR_EC_IMAP_EMAIL)
	i: object id (instanceid from the "singleinstances" SQL table)
	g: server GUID
	P: padding

	Size: always 52 bytes

kcore.hpp:SIEID declares the server GUID as a flexible member, but this is
not strictly necessary as it is always 16 bytes.

SIEID is AF2-conforming.


== Stores ==

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/pidtagrecordkey-canonical-property

Kopano stores are uniquely identified by a GUID (SQL: stores.guid). This value
is exposed as PR_RECORD_KEY on IMsgStore. There is also PR_STORE_RECORD_KEY for
IMsgStore, IMAPIFolder, IMessage, etc.

The PR_ENTRYID for a store (also: PR_STORE_ENTRYID) is constructed at store
creation time and follows the v1 EID.
(ECMsgStore.cpp > CreateEmptyStore > HrCreateEntryId)

Since stores are already uniquely identifiable by the "g" bits, the "u" bits
are practically useless (for stores; not so for folders/messages) and could
just as well be zero when PR_ENTRYID is initially generated for the store.

The store's entryid is not the entryid of the root folder.

The system user receives a hard-coded store GUID and hard-coded EID v0
as PR_ENTRYID [ECDBDef.h]:

	000000008962FFEFFB7B4D639BC5967C4BB5823400000000010000000100000000000000

The root folder of that store is equally hard-coded:

	000000008962FFEFFB7B4D639BC5967C4BB5823400000000030000000200000000000000
	--------ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggvvvvvvvvttttffffnnnnnnnnPPPPPPPP

Other possibly interesting store properties [ECMsgStore.cpp:141]:

	PR_USER_ENTRYID
	PR_MAILBOX_OWNER_ENTRYID
	PR_EMSMDB_SECTION_UID


== Wrapped store entry IDs ==

This non-standard layout is not just a mapi4linux thing; in fact,
zarafa6client.dll (which uses MAPI32 and not mapi4linux) always sends ZCP-style
storewrap EIDs when it does.


== IExchangeManageStore::CreateStoreEntryID ==

Lookup happens by user/mailbox name.
The resolveUserStore RPC respones contains:

	* userid: owner of the store (see section "Security objects")
	* sUserId: ABEID of owner
	* sStoreId: PR_ENTRYID from SQL indexedproperties.val_binary
	* guid: store GUID from SQL stores.guid column


== Basic private store layout ==

Example hierarchy of a private store. List of folders and properties is not exhaustive.
Cf. ECMsgStore.cpp.

/
	PR_IPM_SUBTREE_ENTRYID -> /IPM_SUBTREE
	PR_FINDER_ENTRYID -> /FINDER_ROOT (Search Folders)
	PR_IPM_FAVORITES_ENTRYID -> /Shortcut (Favorites)
	PR_IPM_OUTBOX_ENTRYID -> /Outbox
	ReceiveFolder(*) -> /IPM_SUBTREE/Inbox
/IPM_SUBTREE
	The subtree structure commonly presented in MUAs
/IPM_SUBTREE/Inbox
	Not sure why some PR_IPM_* are here rather than in some parent
	PR_IPM_CONTACT_ENTRYID -> /IPM_SUBTREE/Contacts
	PR_IPM_APPOINTMENT_ENTRYID -> /IPM_SUBTREE/Calendar
	PR_IPM_DRAFTS_ENTRYID -> /IPM_SUBTREE/Drafts
/IPM_SUBTREE/Outbox
/IPM_SUBTREE/Drafts
/IPM_SUBTREE/Contacts
/IPM_SUBTREE/Calendar
/IPM_COMMON_VIEWS
/IPM_VIEWS
/FINDER_ROOT
/Shortcut


== Basic public store layout ==

Example hierarchy of a public store (also terse).

/
/IPM_SUBTREE
	Shown as "Public folder" in MUA
/NON_IPM_SUBTREE
/NON_IPM_SUBTREE/SCHEDULE+ FREE BUSY
/NON_IPM_SUBTREE/SCHEDULE+ FREE BUSY/Zarafa 1
/FINDER_ROOT


== Contacts ==

Contacts are stored as MAPI messages, with a PR_MESSAGE_CLASS="IPM.Contact".
Preferred folder to put these into is PR_IPM_CONTACT_ENTRYID, a folder within
one's private store. The entryid for these contact objects therefore follow EID
v1.


== Address book ==

ABs do not have "folders", they have "containers". Well-known containers
(folders) [various .cpp files]:

	"eidRoot" (MUIDECSAB, MAPI_ABCONT, KOPANO_UID_ADDRESS_BOOK):
	virtual root container

	"abcont_1" (MUIDECSAB, MAPI_ABCONT, KOPANO_UID_GLOBAL_ADDRESS_BOOK):
	"Global Address Book" with all security objects

	-- (MUIDECSAB, MAPI_ABCONT, KOPANO_UID_GLOBAL_ADDRESS_LISTS):
	"All Address Lists"


== Security objects: users/groups/companies ==

The "users" SQL table contains the users, groups and companies. These objects
are sometimes referred to as "security objects" as well, which is to mean
they can be used in, for example, ACLs.

The "users" SQL table contains a server-specific userid (integer), and the
backend-dependent externid (binary). externid is generally the text
representation of uidNumber (RFC2307 LDAP) or the security identifier (MSAD),
or something autogenerated for user_plugin=db. Internal users/groups
(SYSTEM/Everyone) do not have an externid.

userids, groupids and companyids never overlap. Highest supportable objectid in
this scheme is 2^32 - 1. As the SQL database only auto-increments and does not
recycling, a server will eventually exhaust its number space and needs to be
recycled.

Lookup of such entities can happen by way of

	* IECServiceAdmin::ResolveUser / resolveUser RPC
	  (Similarly for groups/companies.)

	* IAddrBook::GetContentsTable + IMAPITable::*

	users: objectclass 0x10001: ACTIVE_USER
	userdb groups: objectclass 0x30002: DISTLIST_SECURITY
	companies: objectlcass 0x40001: CONTAINER_COMPANY

The resolveUser RPC yields a variable-length identifier which looks similar to
an ABEID.

Because entryids are a (client-side) provider thing, a client needs to
interpret the identifier received from the server and construct an entryid to
use for MAPI. (The format happens to be the same at present, so there is no
conversion, but this need not be so forever.)

The objectid is specific to a server. A non-internal user can have multiple ABEIDs:
every server (assuming shared directory like LDAP) that knows about a
particular externid may have the user on record as a different i. Different
amounts of padding can theoretically lead to even more ABEIDs.

As a consequence, trying to reuse an ABEID of this kind for user lookup with
another server is prone to false negatives (using objectid to search and not
finding the user even though externid is right) and false positives (using
objectid to search and finding a user with different externid).

When issuing RPCs like getUser, the ABEID needs to be massaged into a suitable
identifier again.

The well-known hardcoded ABEIDs [ECUnknown.cpp]:

	"g_sEveryOneEid" - the Everyone group
	"g_sSystemEid" - the SYSTEM user


== Unsorted notes ==

PR_RECORD_KEY inside the IMsgServiceAdmin::GetProviderTable is
the default store's GUID.

PR_MDB_PROVIDER on a IMsgStore will be KOPANO_STORE_DELEGATE_GUID (not
KOPANO_SERVICE_GUID) if the store is not the default store of the user.
(Happens, for example, when accessing user stores using the SYSTEM account.)
