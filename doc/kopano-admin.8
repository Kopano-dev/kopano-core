\fBkopano\-admin\fR \fIACTION\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool can be used to create the public store and to add, update and remove users from Kopano. The storage server must be running for
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
to work.
.PP
If no action is given, a listing of the possible parameters is printed. When invalid actions or not enough options for an action are given, an error message is printed.
.PP
When using LDAP as the users source, create, modify and delete actions are done in the LDAP tree and not using the kopano\-admin tool. Please see the
\fBEXTERNAL USERS\fR()
section for more information.

The server has an optimization in which changes to the tproperties table are not writted directly, but delayed for a more efficient write at a later time. The server auto\-purges these regularly.

When a user is removed, the store becomes orphaned. This option shows a list of stores that are not hooked to a user. You can use the

.SH "EXTERNAL USERS"
.PP
When the users are located in an external database, and the storage server is configured to use these users, a lot of commands from the kopano\-admin tool make no sense anymore. An example of an external database, and currently the only option, is an LDAP database.
.PP
The following actions can still be used, all other commands will be automatically triggered by changing the values in the LDAP server.
.PP
\fB\-s\fR: create public store.
.PP
\fB\-l\fR: list users known to Kopano.
.PP
\fB\-L\fR: list groups known to Kopano.
.PP
\fB\-\-details\fR
\fIusername\fR: show user details.
.PP
\fB\-\-sync\fR: trigger full synchronization for users and groups from the external source.
.PP
When the users change in the external source, the Kopano server instantly synchronizes to these changes. There are two exceptions that need some extra attention, and these are when users are created or deleted. When a user is created, the
\fBcreateuser_script\fR
from the
\fBkopano-server.cfg\fR(5)
will be started to create a store for a user. Likewise, when deleting a user, the
\fBdeleteuser_script\fR
from the
\fBkopano-server.cfg\fR(5)
will be started to delete a store from a user. The same is valid for creating and deleting a group and tenant, starting the
\fBcreategroup_script\fR/\fBcreatecompany_script\fR
and
\fBdeletegroup_script\fR/\fBdeletecompany_script\fR
scripts respectively.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP

When you get this error, make sure the storage server and database server are running.
