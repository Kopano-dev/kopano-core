\fBkopano\-admin\fR \fIACTION\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool can be used to create the public store and to add, update and remove users from Kopano. The storage server must be running for
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
to work.
.PP
If no action is given, a listing of the possible parameters is printed. When invalid actions or not enough options for an action are given, an error message is printed.
.PP
When using LDAP as the users source, create, modify and delete actions are done in the LDAP tree and not using the kopano\-admin tool. Please see the
\fBEXTERNAL USERS\fR()
section for more information.

Clears the server\*(Aqs caches. All data cached inside the kopano\-server is cleared. Although this can never cause any data loss, it can affect the performance of your server, since any data requested after the cache is cleared needs to be re\-requested from the database or LDAP server.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-purge\-deferred\fR
.RS 4
The server has an optimization in which changes to the tproperties table are not writted directly, but delayed for a more efficient write at a later time. The server auto\-purges these regularly. This command allows you to purge all changes pending. It may be useful to run this during low I/O load of your server (eg at night).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-orphans\fR
.RS 4
When a user is removed, the store becomes orphaned. This option shows a list of stores that are not hooked to a user. You can use the

from this list.
.RE

.RS 4
You can hook an orphaned store to an existing user, so you may access the store again. Use the

.sp
You can copy an orphaned store to the public store. Use the
\fB\-\-copyto\-public\fR
to copy the store to the public folder named \*(AqAdmin/deleted stores\*(Aq. This folder is then only visible for users with Kopano admin privileges.
.sp
To hook a public store, use
\fB\-\-type\fR

.RE

To unhook a public store, use the

.SH "CONFIG"
.PP
Normally, no configuration file is used or required. If the file
\fI/etc/kopano/admin.cfg\fR
exists, it is used as configuration file, but no error checking is performed. This way, you can use any config file from a kopano program, e.g. kopano\-spooler or kopano\-dagent, to load SSL settings.
.PP
The following options can be set in the configuration file:
.PP
\fBserver_socket\fR
.RS 4
Unix socket to find the connection to the Kopano server.
.sp
Default:
\fIfile:///var/run/kopano/server.sock\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBsslkey_file\fR
.RS 4
Use this file as key to logon to the server. This is only used when server_socket is set to an HTTPS transport. See the
\fBkopano-server\fR(8)
manual page on how to setup SSL keys.
.sp
Default: value not set.
.RE
.PP
\fBsslkey_pass\fR
.RS 4
The password of the SSL key file that is set in sslkey_file.
.sp
Default: value not set.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"

For creating a user:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-c\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fIpassword\fR
\fB\-f\fR
\fI\*(AqFirstname Lastname\*(Aq\fR
\fB\-e\fR
\fIf.lastname@tenant.com\fR
.PP
For creating a non\-login store:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-c\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fIpassword\fR
\fB\-f\fR
\fI\*(AqFirstname Lastname\*(Aq\fR
\fB\-e\fR
\fIf.lastname@tenant.com\fR
\fI\-n\fR

.PP
For modifying the password and e\-mail address:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-u\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fInewpass\fR
\fB\-e\fR
\fIfistname@tenant.com\fR
.PP
For deleting a user:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-d\fR
\fIloginname\fR
.PP
For adding a user to a group:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-b\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-i\fR
\fIgroupname\fR
.PP
For setting a specific quota level for a user. Warning level to 80 Mb, soft level to 90 Mb and hard level to 100 Mb:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-u\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-\-qo\fR
\fIyes\fR
\fB\-\-qw\fR
\fI80\fR
\fB\-\-qs\fR
\fI90\fR
\fB\-\-qh\fR
\fI100\fR
.PP
For automatically accepting meeting requests for a user or resource:
.PP
\fBkopano\-admin\fR
\fB\-u\fR
\fIloginname\fR
\fB\-\-mr\-accept\fR
\fIy\fR
\fB\-\-mr\-decline\-conflict\fR
\fIy\fR
\fB\-\-mr\-decline\-recurring\fR
\fIn\fR
.SH "EXTERNAL USERS"
.PP
When the users are located in an external database, and the storage server is configured to use these users, a lot of commands from the kopano\-admin tool make no sense anymore. An example of an external database, and currently the only option, is an LDAP database.
.PP
The following actions can still be used, all other commands will be automatically triggered by changing the values in the LDAP server.
.PP
\fB\-s\fR: create public store.
.PP
\fB\-l\fR: list users known to Kopano.
.PP
\fB\-L\fR: list groups known to Kopano.
.PP
\fB\-\-details\fR
\fIusername\fR: show user details.
.PP
\fB\-\-sync\fR: trigger full synchronization for users and groups from the external source.
.PP
When the users change in the external source, the Kopano server instantly synchronizes to these changes. There are two exceptions that need some extra attention, and these are when users are created or deleted. When a user is created, the
\fBcreateuser_script\fR
from the
\fBkopano-server.cfg\fR(5)
will be started to create a store for a user. Likewise, when deleting a user, the
\fBdeleteuser_script\fR
from the
\fBkopano-server.cfg\fR(5)
will be started to delete a store from a user. The same is valid for creating and deleting a group and tenant, starting the
\fBcreategroup_script\fR/\fBcreatecompany_script\fR
and
\fBdeletegroup_script\fR/\fBdeletecompany_script\fR
scripts respectively.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Could not create user/store/public store.
.PP
When you get this error, make sure the storage server and database server are running.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
