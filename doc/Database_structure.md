# A quick overview of the Kopano Core database structure


## Overview


The Datbase has the following tables:
```
+--------------------+

+--------------------+
```

## abchanges

Has a journal of all GAB changes -> every change (add/delete/modify) is in this
table.

## acl

List of all acls - each record is an ACE (access control entry) userx has
permissiony on folderz (With a pair record for rights for grant and deny, but
deny was never implemented in the Kopano server) Columns:

* id:
* hierarchy_id:
* type: 2=grant,1=deny
* rights: bitmask of the rights (owner, etc.) - same in mapi defined permissions

## changes

Has a journal of all mailbox changes -> messages in folders added, deleted,
modified - exposed via ICA.

## deferredupdate

Is a per-folder list of changes to tproperties that have not been written to
tproperties yet (for performance reasons)

## hierarchy

Is the parent-child relationship table for the mailbox (IPM_SUBTREE_ROOT -> ...)

Columns
* id:
* parent:
* type: 1=mailbox, 3=folder, 5=message, 6=recipient, 7=attachment
* flags: folders:0=root folder,1=normal folder,2=search folder;
   messages:0=normal message, 64=associative message, 1024=deleted
* owner:

## indexedproperties

Mapping between from certain properties to their hierarchyid example:
PR_ENTRY_ID abcdef match to hierarchy.id 12345

## lob

Attachments chunked into 256K blocks (only in mysql-stored format)

## Names

Nothing but named properties mapping to property IDs — property IDs are
subtracted by 0x8500.

## outgoingqueue

Two things: 1. queue that outlook polls for messages that it wants to send, 2.
queue of spooler, of messages that it wants to send

Columns:
* flags: if even then outlook queue, if odd spooler queue
* properties - the list of properties for each hierarchy.id - each value is put
  into its corresponding column type (binary, double, etc.)
* mvproperties - looks exactly the same, but it also has orderid, so there can
* be multiple records for the same property for the same hierarchy.id (done for
  performance reasons)

## receivefolder

It points at which folder is your actual receivefolder in your hierarchy

## searchresults

When you do a search all of the results are saved and updated forever until you
delete the search folder settings - random server-wide settings

## singleinstances

Record of attachment-deduplication (single instance store)

## stores

links stores to users (hierarchy.id to users.id)

## syncedmessages

Is used in restricted ICS (when we cannot use the journal) - sync only the last 4
weeks is an example. This represents the messages that have been sent to a
mobile. only for z-push

## syncs

A list of all folders that are being tracked for ICS - we do not really use it,
we only write to it (investigation, maybe?)

## tproperties

The list of properties for each hierarchy.id - each value is put into its
corresponding column type (binary, double, etc.) *BUT* It only contains the
properties that can be seen in tables therefore excludes attachments and
recipients everything is truncated to 255 bytes or characters.

## users

Users table with the relation column (externid)

## versions

List of all Kopano versions ever installed on the system


## Tables specific for DB plugin

- object - everything normally in ldap
- objectmvproperty - everything normally in ldap
- objectproperty - everything normally in ldap
- objectrelation - everything normally in ldap
