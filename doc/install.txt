Building

As is common for autotools-based projects, if there is no "configure" file
in your download, it has to be created with `autoreconf -fi`. There is a
`bootstrap.sh` file in KC that can also be used.


About VMIME

Upstream VMIME is presently not doing regular releases and there is no trivial
way to enforce a particular version. Therefore, Kopano's VMIME repository
updates the Version tag itself and uses that as a minimum requirement for the
PKG_CHECK_MODULE check.

To use a non-Kopano vmime, the version check needs to be overridden with:

	./configure vmime_CFLAGS="$(pkg-config vmime --cflags)" \
		vmime_LIBS="$(pkg-config vmime --libs)"
