[\fIstart\fR|
\fIstop\fR|
\fIrestart\fR]
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
The following signals can be sent to the kopano\-spooler process:
.PP
\fBHUP\fR
.RS 4
When the HUP signal is received, some options from the configuration file are reloaded. The reloadable options are listed in the
\fBkopano-spooler.cfg\fR(5)
manual page.
.sp
Also, when using
\fIlog_method = file\fR, the logfile will be closed and a new logfile will be opened. You can use this signal in your logrotate system.
.RE
.PP
\fBTERM\fR
.RS 4
To gracefully let the service exit, the normal TERM signal is used. Because of multiple running threads, it may take up to 60 seconds for the server to completely shutdown.
