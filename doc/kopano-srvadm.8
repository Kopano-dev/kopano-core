.SH Description
.PP
This tool is used to control certain aspects of the Kopano server, specifically
internal state.
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig-file\fP
Location of a config file to read.
.PP
Default: \fI/etc/kopano/admin.cfg\fP
.TP
\fB\-h\fP \fIhost\fP
URI for a specific server to connect to and execute the action on.
.PP
Default: \fIdefault:\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-clear\-cache \fP\fIpool\fP[\fB,\fP\fIpool\fP...]
Flushes one or more of the server's cache pools. The argument shall be a
comma-separated list of pool names, which can be: \fBquota\fP,
\fBquotadefault\fP, \fBobject\fP, \fBstore\fP, \fBacl\fP, \fBcell\fP,
\fBindex1\fP, \fBindex2\fP, \fBindexedproperty\fP, \fBuserobject\fP,
\fBexternid\fP, \fBuserdetail\fP, \fBserver\fP, or the magic value \fBall\fP.
Although this operation never causes any data loss, it can affect the
performance of the server, since any data requested after the cache has been
cleared needs to be re-requested from the database or LDAP server. Normally,
this option is never needed; it is mostly used as a diagnostic.
.TP
\fB\-\-purge\-deferred\fP
The server has an optimization in which changes to the "tproperties" table are
not writted directly, but delayed for a more efficient write at a later time.
The server auto-purges these regularly. This command allows you to manually
start a purge of all pending changes. It may be useful to run this during low
I/O load of your server, e.g. at night.
.TP
\fB\-\-purge\-softdelete\fP \fIdays\fP
Starts a softdelete purge on the server, removing all soft-deleted items which
have been deleted and which are older than the specified number of days.
