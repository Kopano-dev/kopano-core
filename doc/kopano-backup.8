kopano-backup \- The Kopano Backup tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBkopano\-backup\fR\ 'u
\fBkopano\-backup\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fIPATH\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Kopano\-backup is used to create or restore backups of user data, such as one or more stores or folders. This includes emails, calendar items, contacts, etc., as well as user settings such as rules, permissions and WebApp settings.
.PP
Backups are performed incrementally, when for a given user/store there already exists a backup directory. This means that only the changes which occurred since the last backup run are processed.
.PP
For backup (not restore) it is possible to process multiple stores in parallel.
.PP
There are options to inspect the contents of a backup directory, and to restore only individual messages/items.
