Test to see what happens if a multibyte character is segmented
into multiple RFC "encoded-word"s.

Possible outcomes:

 - dropping incomplete sequences at end of encoded-words

 - concatenation where possible (where encoded-words of same charset
   are next to each other)

What they do comes down to implementation (mostly of third parties
like iconv).
